- A script to fetch the graph points from the lnt graphs. The script filters out data points earlier than one months.

- Replace url variable in the script to fetch other websites. E.g. http://lnt.llvm.org/db_default/v4/nts/graph?highlight_run=145408&plot.1605785=1364.1605785.3

- Url html source is cached in this folder, act as proxy to reduce response time. If you want to re-fetch the url, delete the cache then rerun the script.
